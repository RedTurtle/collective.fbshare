Add new meta tags to you Plone site, for better controlling how your items are **shared on Facebook**. 

.. contents:: **Table of contents**

Introduction
============

Are you commonly sharing contents from your Plone site or a site page to a `Facebook`__ account?

__ http://www.facebook.com/

When you use the nice Facebook sharing interface, you have a simple way to customize additional data for the item
that will be published (mainly: choose a proper image from the remote page).
However when trying to do this automatically (e.g: you are publishing the link in a `Twitter`__ account that also
feed a Facebook page) Facebook is choosing an image for you... and often this is not the image you want.

How can you solve this? In general you can provide some additional ``meta`` tag information using
`Open Graph standard`__, customizing many aspect of the way of sharing contents on Facebook.

------------

In the site control panel you can access a new configuration panel named "*Open Graph sharing settings*".
From there you can:

* provide a custom image content to be used as ``og:image``
* choose to use the site's logo as ``og:image``
* enable support for content images, this mean that content types with image field will be able to
  provide that image instead of a global ones.

Coexistence with sc.social.like
===============================

Another very common plugin that add ``meta`` tag in Plone Pages is `sc.social.like`__.

As adding duplicate meta tag is reported as an error by Facebook verification, *collective.fbshare* will
hide some of the *sc.social.like* HTML elements when both products are installed.
